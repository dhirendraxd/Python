# we can print below wise also 
for i in range(10) : # the print will print upto 10 and then stop 
    print(i)

for i in range(2,10): # now this loop will start form 2 and then end at 9 or 10 depends 
    print(i) # the output is from 2 to 9 


for i in range(2, 10 ,2) : # the loop will start from 2 and stop at 10 and in each iteration it will increase by 2 
    print(i) # this will print all the even numebr upto 8
