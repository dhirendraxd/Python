#converting integer to float likewise

print(sum)
# float is superior so it will retunr value in flaoting point

#  typecasting
a,b=a,"2"
c=int(b)
sum=a+c

#typecasting insidea  a string
a=2.4
a=str(a)
print(type(a)) # now the a will be printed as str meaning ita a string it cant be used but it is called as a string  while getting its type
